My projects from 100 Days of Code Challenge (Days 1 through 10)

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 23, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Printing, Commenting, Debugging, String Manipulation and Variables.

**Today's Progress**: Created a very simple Python app that creates a band name using the city you grew up in and your pet's name.

**Thoughts:** After coding in Ruby and JavaScript for the past year, it really nice to give Python a try. These topics were very basic and not that difficult but I feel it was good enough for this first day.

### Day 2: March 24, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Data Types, Numbers, Operation, Type Conversion, and f-Stings.

**Today's Progress**: Learned the data types in Python. Yesterday, I learned about Strings but today I learned integers, floats, and boolean. I focused on the data types of integers and floats and calculating using order of operations (EPMDAS). I also learned f-strings, which is a way to concatenate variables with values into a string. It reminded me a bit like template literals in JavaScript. Using all that I learned, I created another simple CLI python app which is a tip calculator. It asks for the total of the bill, percentage of tip you would like to give, and number of people in the party. The app calculates how much each person owes for the total bill plus tip.

**Thoughts:** I am math geek so today was a lot of fun learning how to perform mathematical functions in Python. Inputs take in numbers as strings, so it was a bit confusing making sure I knew the data type. And then how integers do not round. So that to me was the most challenging part of the day.

### Day 3: March 25, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Conditionals, Logic Operators, Code Blocks and Scope.

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on with Python basics, today I learned control flow with if/else and conditional operators, nested if and elif statements, multiple if statements in succession, and logic operators. To demonstrate my learning today, I created a simple CLI app that to get through to the treasure, you have to answer each question correct to advance to the next.

**Thoughts:** At least at this point in learning Python, I must say the syntax does seem easy to me. I imagine things will get a bit more complex as I progress. I feel the best way is baby steps with the fundamentals to ensure a solid foundation.

### Day 4: March 26, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Randomisation and Python Lists.

**Today's Progress**: I learned about Python's Random module, which is used to generate random numbers (either floats or integers). Lists are a data structure in Python. And you can nested lists. As the project for today, I made a CLI app to play Rock, Paper, Scissors.

**Thoughts:** I had no idea how robust the Python Random module was. But since it used for Data Science, it must need to handle some extreme mathematical calculations.

### Day 5: March 27 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Loops, Range, and Code Blocks.

**Today's Progress**: I learned about loops in Python. In The For Loop, indentation of code to the same length (so it is vertically stacked) creates the code block to be executed each time the For Loop runs. Also learned about for loops and the range() function. The second argument in the range function does not include that last number. For today's project, I made a password generator CLI app in Python.

**Thoughts:** Indentation is really important in Python. It will break you code if it is not done properly in the code syntax. To be in a code block, every line has to be indented to the same length for the code to work properly. Which makes sense since Python was designed to be opinionated. This script I made to generate a password might really come in handy when I need to make a password!

### Day 6: March 28 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Functions, Code Blocks, and While Loops

**Today's Progress**: Introduced to Functions in Python. Again the syntax seems very intuitive and indentation of the code block is imperative to the function properly executing. I also read about the spaces vs tab argument with indentation. According to PEP 8 Python3, four spaces should be used for indentation (vs hitting the tab bar). But with modern code editors, this really isn't an issue. I have been using Python3 in VS Code and the prettier extension formats it properly for me.

**Thoughts:** Today was a fun learning day by getting the robot through the maze in the Reeborg's World tutorial website. It was probably my most challenge day thus far in the 6 days, but still was fun to figure out the algorithm to get the robot through the maze.

### Day 7: April 1 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Build the Hangman game.

**Today's Progress**: This project combined everything I have learned about Python in my previous six days of my 100 Days of Code. It included: For & While Loops, IF/ELSE statements, Lists, Strings, Range and Modules.

**Thoughts:** This took a lot longer than I thought. The game is pretty simple as a whole, but when I tried to piece together the logic in my head, it was really difficult. It worked much better once I had sketched the logic into a flowchart. And then it came together much easier.

### Day 8: April 4 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Functions with Inputs, Arguments, and Parameters.

**Today's Progress**: Stretched a bit with functions with inputs. Also learned using parameters and arguments in functions, including keyword arguments. For today's project, I build an encoding and decoding a string based on some shift in encoding and decoding each letter in the string.

**Thoughts:** The more I learn Python, the more I like it. I look forward to each day in this challenge by going deeper and deeper into Python.

### Day 9: April 5 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Dictionaries and Nesting Lists/Dictionaries.

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Dictionaries in Python and how to add, delete, and edit items in the dictionary. I also learned about nested lists in a dictionary, nested dictionaries in a dictionary, nested dictionaries in lists. For today's project, I build a blind auction app.

**Thoughts:** Dictionaries and nested lists/dictionaries made a lot of sense. Dictionaries are like objects in JavaScript. The most difficult part was the traversing nested dictionaries/lists.

### Day 10: April 6 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Functions with Outputs.

**Today's Progress**: Today, I learned Python functions with outputs. And the difference between using print and return. Also learned about using docstrings to describe what a function does in a form of documentation. Also, diving deeper into while loops using Flags, and Recursion. Recursion is a function calling itself which is useful in while loops when you want to restart the function.

**Thoughts:** To solidify today's learning, I built a calculator CLI app. I am now one-tenth through the 100 Days Code Challenge. These past 10 days have been on the basics. And I feel I know enough to use all I have learned and create a mini-capstone project tomorrow.
