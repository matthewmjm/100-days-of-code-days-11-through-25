# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: April 8, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Mini-capstone for all I have learned from Day 1 through Day 10.

**Today's Progress**: Created a Blackjack CLI game in Python.

**Thoughts:** This was an ambitious project for me with only 10 days of learning Python for only an hour or two a day. I really pushed myself and did not look up any possible solutions on Google. I was determined to get it on my own. And though it took me a couple days, I am proud to say I did it! The one functionality I did not get to was how an Ace can worth either 1 or 11. In my game, it was only worth 11. Eventually, I will get back to this and add that functionality. Perhaps it will be easier as I learn more Python in the days to come.
