# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: April 8, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Mini-capstone for all I have learned from Day 1 through Day 10.

**Today's Progress**: Created a Blackjack CLI game in Python.

**Thoughts:** This was an ambitious project for me with only 10 days of learning Python for only an hour or two a day. I really pushed myself and did not look up any possible solutions on Google. I was determined to get it on my own. And though it took me a couple days, I am proud to say I did it! The one functionality I did not get to was how an Ace can worth either 1 or 11. In my game, it was only worth 11. Eventually, I will get back to this and add that functionality. Perhaps it will be easier as I learn more Python in the days to come.

### Day 12: April 11, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Namespaces: Local vs. Global Scope and Python (Global) Constants & Global Scope.

**Today's Progress**: After working on my last project, which was a culmination of what I have learned from Day 1 through Day 10, I ran into some scope issues and wanted to get some clarification on how scope works in Python. I learned about Global Scope and Local Scope, how to modify Global scope with 'global' inside a function (but it is best practice that you try not to - perhaps manipulated global scope with a function that returns the modification, if necessary). Also, I learned about constants in Python, which are designated by all capital letters in the name. These are not to be changed. I also learned that Python does not have block scope. Today's project was using what I learned today to create a CLI number guessing game.

**Thoughts:** The deeper I go into Python, the more I find myself comparing it to a language that I know very well, JavaScript. There are differences between the two. Like Python does not have hoisting, like JavaScript. I believe as I make note of the differences, it will benefit me greatly as I switch between the two.

### Day 13: April 12, 2021

**Today's Topics**: JavaScript: .

**Today's Progress**: Deciding to take a day off of Python and code with JavaScript. I used "JavaScript30" by Wes Bos for today's project. This was to build a JS Drum Kit. The first thing that was new to me was this concept of HTML custom attributes that are prefixed by "data-"\*. In this project, the custom attribute was "data-key" which corresponding to the value of the JavaScript keycode (see keycode.info) which provides the value (keycode) of each key on the keyboard. For instance, the 'a' key is 65. This is what is used to signal which audio (wav) file is played by your browser. This project also focuses on event listeners (pressing key) and querySelector (for audio that corresponds to the key). Also, it worth pointing out the the keyCode property on the keyboard event has since been deprecated.
