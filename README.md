# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: April 8, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Mini-capstone for all I have learned from Day 1 through Day 10.

**Today's Progress**: Created a Blackjack CLI game in Python.

**Thoughts:** This was an ambitious project for me with only 10 days of learning Python for only an hour or two a day. I really pushed myself and did not look up any possible solutions on Google. I was determined to get it on my own. And though it took me a couple days, I am proud to say I did it! The one functionality I did not get to was how an Ace can worth either 1 or 11. In my game, it was only worth 11. Eventually, I will get back to this and add that functionality. Perhaps it will be easier as I learn more Python in the days to come.

### Day 12: April 11, 2021

**Today's Topics**: Python: Namespaces: Local vs. Global Scope and Python (Global) Constants & Global Scope.

**Today's Progress**: After working on my last project and Day 10, I ran into some scope issues and wanted to get some clarification on how scope works in Python. I learned about Global Scope and Local Scope, how to modify Global scope with 'global' inside a function (but it is best practice that you try not to - perhaps manipulated global scope with a function that returns the modification, if necessary). Also, I learned about constants in Python, which are designated by all capital letters in the name. These are not to be changed. I also learned that Python does not have block scope. Today's project was using what I learned today to create a CLI number guessing game.

**Thoughts:** The deeper I go into Python, the more I have to compare it to a language that I know very well, JavaScript. There are differences between the two. Like Python does not have hoisting, like JavaScript. I believe as I make note of the differences, it will benefit me greatly as I switch between the two.
